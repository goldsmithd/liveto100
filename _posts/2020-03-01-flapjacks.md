**Step 1)** Mash the bananas with a fork and add the dates and oil and mix well.<br>

**Step 2)** Sire in the oats and the other ingredients, except for the sugar, and mix well, I find using the fork in a mixing bowl works really well much better than a spoon.<br>

**Step 3)** Add to a tray pressing as you add and sprinkle the sugar over the mixture. Cook for around 25 mins or so on around 170 degrees for a fan oven or 180 degrees for a conventional oven. keep an eye on it while it cooks so you do not get burnt flapjacks.

**Step 3)** Once it is cooked, leave for 10 mins or so until a little cooler and score the mixture into slices. Then enjoy !

Try experimenting with different nuts and seeds, the sugar sprinkled on top also give a crunch and the illusion of more sweetness.
