The only tricky part of this is the pastry which frankly isnt worth making yourself. Apart from that the rest is really easy.

## Method

## Pastry

**Step 1)** Add the dry ingredients into a bowl and mix well.<br>

**Step 2)** Add the oil and mix with your hands into a sort of breadcrumb consistency. Then add the lemon and then kneed into a ball and add milk, just enough to make the ball sticky but workable. Dont overkneed the mixture.<br>

**Step 3)** leave the pastry as a ball in the fridge for 15-20 mins, while you make the filling.

**Step 4)** Mash the potatoes and Butternut Squash with the Almond milk or you can use margarin


## Filling

**Step 5)** Peel and chop the carrots and chop the onion and celery finely, if you like chunky onion then that can be left bigger.<br>

**Step 6)** Peel the Swede and Chop into around 1/2cm cubes measure out the frozen peas too.<br>

**Step 7)** Make the gravy - crumble the veg stock cube and add the gravy granules into around 1 pint, or more if you like. Microwave for 2 mins and stir then microwave for another minute when you are going to add to the mixture.<br>

**Step 8)** Add all the filling ingredients and seasoning to a pot with the seasoning and the gravy and simmer for around 10 mins. Top tip do not add too much gravy as otherwise the filling will simply leak out of the pastry, you have been warned <br>

## Bringing it all together

**Step 9)** Split the pasty into thirds and roll each third into a ball. Roll out the pastry and add a third of the mixture onto the pastry and draw the sides up. Seal with water or a little milk. You can see by the picture this was a tricky operation in which I failed :-(.

**Step 10)** cook for around 30 mins or so on around 180 degrees for a fan oven or 200 degrees for a conventional oven. Any left over pasties can be frozen prior to cooking. Serve with loads of Veg and the left over gravy.

These pasties are very filling and because you can batch make them they are a great thing to pull out of the freezer as and when needed.
