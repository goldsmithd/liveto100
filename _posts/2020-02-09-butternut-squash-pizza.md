## Method

**Step 1)** I made this manually, you can us a mixer with a dough hook but as I was only making one manual worked well. Put the flour in a mixing bowl and add the yeast. Dry mix before adding the water. I would warm the water first and only add 3/4 of it and start to mix with a spoon or your hand. When the dough is of a wet ball consistency you can start to kneed it.

**Step 2)** When kneading the dough you are after a springiness to the dough so that if you press it in it springs back. Use some plain flour as the base to knead on otherwise it will simply stick to the chopping board or worksurface. This takes around 10 minutes of kneading.  Once you have that spring in the dough cover with a cloth and leave in a warm place for 2-4 hours. The dough will get around 30-40% bigger after this time.


**Step 3)** Whilst waiting for the dough to rise you can prepare the butter knut Squash and the other vegitables. For the Squash remove the seeds and peal the outside. then cut into around 1/2 inch cubes. Cover with water and bring to the boil then let simmer for around 10 min or until the Squash is soft. You can then mash it with your choice of milk.

**Step 4)** once the dough has risen then knock it back by simply giving it a thump and it will sort of delate. You can then stretch it out. You can use a roller but I found that just pulling it around a bit seemed to work ok. I cannot say mine was round though !

**Step 5)** spread the Butternut Squash on the Pizza base. I used the back of a spoon but you can also use a fork to give it some texture.

**Step 6)** add the Beans and Vegetables. I added the Vegetables raw but you can seam them a little before if you prefer. if you use a steamer then I would suggest steaming them for 1/2 the time you would usually as otherwise they will go a bit limp in the oven.

**Step 7)**
Put in the oven - 180 Degrees and keep an eye on it as the vegetables can easily burn. One thing you need to do is to make sure the middle of the dough is as thin as the rest of it as otherwise it wont cook properly. Or you can make the Butternut Squash a bit thinner in the middle.

The end result is a little variable, you can put some Vegetarian cheese on top if you prefer.
